1. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

 SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
 FROM STATION
 WHERE LEFT(CITY, 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');

2. Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than 75 Marks. 
Order your output by the last three characters of each name. 
If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

SELECT NAME
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE MARKS > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME, 3), ID;

3. Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. 
Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
    Equilateral: It's a triangle with 

    a) sides of equal length.
    b) Isosceles: It's a triangle with
    c) sides of equal length.
    d) Scalene: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
    e) Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
    
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
    WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
    WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
    ELSE 'Scalene'
  END as Triangle_Type
FROM TRIANGLES;

4. Query the average population for all cities in CITY, rounded down to the nearest integer.
 SELECT FLOOR(AVG(Population))
 FROM CITY;
